  Hey there! This entire website is a massive experiment. Feel free to keep clicking around, reading, listening, or if it feels like it's not your thing, no hard feelings!

This website provides the informational/explanatory backing for the `A Failure to Disagree` podcast.

{% include podcast-subscribe-banner.html %}


The title comes from [a paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19739881/) I read a while back. The paper is join-authored by Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein, titled:

**Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree** 

_Get the paper on Scihub [here](https://sci-hub.st/10.1037/a0016755)_

I've thought of this paper often. It was written by two "opposed" giants in the field of "intuition and expertise". The authors collaborated on the paper to explore where their views overlapped and differed. 

Here's the beginning of the second paragraph of the paper:

> A surprise awaited us when we got together to consider our joint field of interest. **We found ourselves agreeing most of the time.** Where we initially disagreed, we were usually able to converge upon a common position.

And thus, this project was born. I'd like to find where it *seems* like myself and someone else might be in disagreement, and I'll see if we can end up in agreement.

A large portion of what I'll be discussing is material that's interesting because of how provocative it is, or because of how it hints at underlying structures and realities in the world around us. 

I'm putting time and money into this project. I use [rev.com](https://www.rev.com/) for transcripts, and it costs me between $15 and $75 per episode. ($15 for the machine-generated, 80% accurate transcript, $75 for human-perfected, 99% accurate transcripts).

If you're listening to these, please [sponsor me on github.com](https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works). At minimum, [I request $1/mo](https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works/sponsorships?sponsor=josh-works&tier_id=58616&preview=false). I know for a fact it's more inconvenient to create a Github account (if needed) and then add a credit card than the fact that you're parting with a dollar a month.

If you're making solid money, and have the price of two Chipotle burritos to spare, [sponsor me at $14/mo](https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works/sponsorships?sponsor=josh-works&tier_id=58591&preview=false).

Your support, even at $1, is helpful to me in a way that is probably surprising to you. Start supporting me, and I'll explain why. :)
