I am on a zoom call. I didn't really know what to expect. 5 min in, it's blowing my mind. Here's the abstract:

> In this month's Lab, we will discuss the organization behind the figurative curtain of municipal finances: GASB, or the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. Weâ€™ll answer questions like: How are the standards by which we measure the fiscal health of our cities set? What can we do to change standards that influence the way we view infrastructure? Joe will be joined by special guests, Shelia Weinberg, Charles Marohn, and Scott Bernstein.  
zzzzzzzzzz

BOOOOORING. 

Turns out it's an academic, dry presentation about why _we're getting completely screwed by our local city governments_. 

Of course, the guests don't quite see it this way, but they're describing a situation where this is the case. 



I just joined a Zoom presentation from urban3 (http://www.urban-three.com/), the CEO is talking about changes to municipal finance accounting standards, with some interesting guests.

Featuring:

Charles Marohn - known as "Chuck" to friends and colleagues - is the Founder and President of Strong Towns and the author of Strong Towns: A Bottom-Up Revolution to Rebuild American Prosperity. Read more about Chuck HERE. 

Scott Bernstein - is Founder and Director Emeritus of the Center for Neighborhood Technology. Read more about Scott HERE. 

It's already super interesting, I wondered if y'all might be interested in attending. It started at 11a local, running until noon. I should have given y'all a heads up days ago about this! 

# Notes

## Introduction


## First Guest: Sheila Weinberg

- Data-Z, Truth In Accounting
- Financial State of the State (get link)
- FSB (Financial state Accounting Board)
- Government accounting differs starkly from "public" accounting, has resisted 
- Government "standards" are set by an "independent board" of government standards
- government has worked hard to hide public picture of finances (Dictator's handbook: why bad government is good politics)
- "modified accrual accounting" (lol. She's hilarious.)
- "basically, states don't balance their budget, are lying through their teeth, acting like their budgets are balanced"
- she thinks a vote will fix this (legislation happening tomorrow)


I disagree - this is the _intended benefit_ of the government being able to give lipservice to strict accounting, and allow themselves to waste money on themselves. (again, the government to )

- IRS Doesn't allow public companies to report financial "cash basis", even as LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE GOVERNMENT OFFICE


## Guest 2: Scott Bernstein

- "basically, accounting is a beneficial thing to human societies, because it helps you manage really important metrics of your business."
- "if you need to spend money, you need to know if you have it"
- "if you're managing other companies, you want to see their standards disclosed in plain english"
- "in most government accounting systems, they immediately violate all of these public rules"
- "governments just... tell stories about things... in their financial reports" (or do I have this backwards?)

If you are good at managing your stuff, you get to be proud of yourself, brag about it. 

"Yeah, we take care of our stuff. The environment, our capital assets, our buildings, our green space, our businesses"

- "the dude that built golden-gate-bridge was asked 'how long do you want this bridge to last' and he said 'forever'."

- "we want to do things that last. we want an ROI. We want a better ROI for doing things well"

- these are people who LOVE their hometowns. They so want such good things for their children, for the environment. They want to be wise, prudent stewards of their resources. 

## Guest 3: Chuck of Strong Towns 

- sharing an article from Malcom Gladwell from 2007, about Enron, and Enron's accounting: [Open Secrets: Enron, Intelligence, and the perlis of too much information (Malcom Gladwell, the New Yorker)](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/01/08/open-secrets-3)
- gladwell: Enron was actually transparent about what they were doing. They reported their off-book accounts named after starwards figures. (lol wut)?

- "I read an article of a finance officer in the government criticizing the GASB movement because 'all our financial shit is in the accounts!'. and I thought "yeah, it's in there, in the same way that Enron's accountings were in their books."

Lol Chuck is an anarchist and doesn't even know it. 

- "people used to hold city governments to standards, and made sure they delivered. You've got cities SCREWING THEIR POPULATIONS with HORRIFIC DECISIONMAKING that is HORRIBLE by the standards that we hold businesses to, and the city governments are trying desperately to hide this fact"

again - THIS IS THE POINT! Governments are rewarding themselves with the same incentives that we recognize dictators depend upon. [dictator's handbook], [problem of political authority], [the power broker]

"The public itself is being misled by this opaque, exotic system". The public is being told "we'll be fine, financially" (obviously, because this is)

This is misleading bc the public is willing and happy to pay for important things (streets, parks, disposal systems, etc) but also assets, like roads, sewer lines, water lines, etc

the public things the government is also maintaining the things it pays for

(this explains the gap that government rewards itself with, political patronage? naked power grab? I think)

Break in trust, with how the government reports upon itself to the persons it saves. 

## Sheila, responding to Chuck:

"yeah, Chicago public schools is perfect example. They don't have enough money on annual basis to pay even the minimum on their pension public credit card, but still the population gets told that they're responsible, right before contract negotiations w/labor union, who uses that gap to argue for higher pay"

Ah, here's the `important` people. `interchangables`, `importants`, `criticals`?

Chicago Public Schools straight up lies about the money situation. It's obvious that this is true.

## Joe M, response:

"is there a good model of municipal accounting? is anyone doing it rigth?"

## Sheila:

"Yeah, Utah. They're the one place that does it right." 

"so I went there and said 'well, what are you doing right'"

gov: "we do something strange, we only offer services that we can afford"

aus, NZ, "full accrual accounting, good examples of persons to pattern match upon, so public can tell 'did we increase our debt? decrease our debt?'"

me: yeah, of course, this is how society is meant to progress. Going _with_ the grain of human nature

## Joe, asking Scott 'wh'

oh, yeah, their desired outcome? pass a little legislation on the government itself? totally wrong. never going to work. asking the fox to guard the henhouse. CF "The Power Broker"

## Scott:

"we need this. Just basic reasonable publishing of data about how our cities are run would allow SO MANY GOOD THINGS to happen, and would prevent SO MUCH HARM!"

CF "Order Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities" (alain says "lets just run our cities like reasonable people, and we can improve the wellbeing of nearly everyone!")

Scott, reinforcing this point. 

It's screamingly obvious that these persons are making really, really plain points.

"it's helpful to know if a road has 40 years of life yet, or 2 years of life. That's really important for building budgets"

But government tells us NOTHING about how much useful life is left, easily. They tell us the same way Enron told us, right before Enron was the _most public example of financial malfesience_. 

Me: Lol@the idea of government prosecuting itself. Incentives/power dynamics wrong. People need to non-violently expect government to do this, and strongly encourage government officials at all levels to take steps in these directions, and reward them handsomly for doing so, while using data gained to hold rest of government officials to account.

We have to expect bad actors in the government. Robert Moses is a perfect example. He had power, he was resistent to people fighting him _via his systems_. He lost when the public simply learned of how harmful he was to the city. 

Didn't require a change of public/human nature. They just saw him, and he lost his power.

We need to do the same.

## Joe to Chuck: "you've been trying to get people to pay attention to the cost of paying for road maintence across 40 years"

"we have to go to a few other cities in the world to find"

Chuck: Because private sector counts costs better than government, we don't have to go JUST to new zealand

"this shoes the brokenness of 'oh, government doesn't have to be like business"... yeah, that's true, but when we get to city governments, THEY ARE LITERALLY BUSINESSES! They don't have access to printing money, complicated financial instruments like the FED and FDIC...

Local government doesn't need to be like THE WORST of businesses that we can think of, but they should be run like a company, like... THE FACT THAT COMPANIES HAVE TO REPORT ON THEIR INCOME AND EXPENSE.

It's not hard to do this. The fact that cities can account their money the way they can... 

It's like me ignoring the fact (in my family accounting) that my daughter is going to college next year and my expenses are going up tens of thousands of dollars. 

"it's like saying 'we're fine on our spending if we can pay the minimum on our CC bill, and are gladly spending $5000 more per month than we're earning."

DICTATOR'S HANDBOOK! Explore the incentives.

"governments shouldn't be in the business of LOSING money. They shouldn't be expected to literally last forever, and they should at least act like they're not going to live forever and always be able to spend whatever the hell they want!"

And... yeah. Again, govt. rewarding itself at great expense? I'd rather just... pay 1/3rd gov't officials 1/2 their current salary if they'd go away and quit their jobs, help hand off their portion of "the business". 

1/3rd of the gov't officials could prob start replacing 1/2 their current incomes by "privatizing" their servics. 

(I'd pay local govt' officials for good help planning/building on my property). 

1/3rd gov't officials would wanna quit their job and take a trip/explore alternative work arrangements

10% gov't officials would want to violently resist their loss of power. 

The rest of us (the other 95% of the population of the USA) can peacefully, helpfully, guide these persons to a peaceful place. 

My dad supports the military (and therefore murder) and hates liberals. He thinks they're literally evil. He gives SUCH GOOD MEDICAL CARE to his gay/trans medical students in private practice. The proudest I've been of him is when he's just doing his damn job. He's great at it. 

You, the most liberal person, might hate him. He has a lot of ideas that are (to me) stupid. I don't have to worry about that. I can be SO EXCITED for the quality of care he gives.

So, he'd be part of that 10% that almost violently resists his loss of power, but I think he can be won over.

And if he can be won over, anyone can be won over.

....

Scott, still: "you really can't do anything good for your children without understanding the basics of this stuff"

Scott. He's old. He's thinking of his legacy. He WANTS his local government to brag about how good they are at providing long-term value to their population. He WANTS his daughter to grow up in a town that serves her better than it does today, instead of worse. 

Basically... let us care for our kids. I'm a finance guy. I want to care of my kids financially.

# Q&A

## "Is there _any_ organization that can influence change from the outside?"

"is there an interest group, institution, corportation, etc, that can influence _any_ change on this thing itself?"

Sheila: All they do, to get these standards, is they go to government-filled "public" conferences, say "we're putting some standards together, what do you think we need'? "

it's SUCH a rigged show. (Please see Robert Moses, stuffing ballots early in his career)

Chuck: "i talk w/2 congress people in an upcoming video. IN THAT CONVERSATION, they brought up this GASB thing"

"they're tuned in to the fact that this shit is messed up, and they want to guide the city/country to be a better, healthier place. They're conservative, small-town people that just want to see the world be better 10 years from now than it is today"

(common thread - all involved persons want the world to be better. All my family wants the world to be better, my friends. I don't hang out with people that don't want the world to be better. )

they're completely missing the mechanisms of change. Power Broker, Rules for Radicals, Seeing like a State, TPPA

### REDLINING! 

"the way redlining got stopped was by people pushing for financial disclosures". OOOOOOH SHIT

he just tied in "if you want to end institutional oppression against black people, you need to support this issue"

AKA If you're interested in NOT SUPPORTING SLAVERY you should do what I suggest.... (me, josh)

## Joe: OK, so how do people get involved?

"start with the report they do have. Most governments have it: "comprehensive annual report", it's 200-400 pages

> we have a video helping you find this
"focus on unrestricted net position", OK, so cities start saying to government:

"ok, I know you're doing this on a cash basis, but how much debt did you incur? how much did liabilities go up? did you pay your debt this year?"

## Scott:

"ask local councils AND PLANNING DIRECTORS the relationship between spending the money and their stated goals for the city"

"you need to know if you have a park for rainwater capture or a sewer. You also need to know if this is an ADEQUATE solution."

### Climate Change

Just tied in climate change - lots of poeple talking about solutions to climate change, but we MUST ask "ok, but is it good enough? if it fast enough? is it likely enough? IS THIS MOVING US AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO A PROBLEM TO THIS REALLY BIG PROBLEM?"

The other institution: form partnerships with whats left of the media (I HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS!!!) 

Keep pressure via editorial boards. Cities are very succeptible to that. They really want the public to think that there's no fraud, nothing illegal going on, and they're sensitive to public criticism.

## Chuck:

### Public words officials and finance people need to talk together

We need to simply have the financial people in the city talk with the planning part of the city. 

Chuck: Wwe have had success asking cities to just write a 2nd report, that accounts for this stuff. It's actually pretty easy, even if it's informal reporting on the side.

"You're only gonna get that if the public works and finance people sit down and produce this report."

### it is possible, only if they want to do it

Public words want to do projects (yep)

finance people want to balance budgets (yep)

if they work together, they can actually make really big gains. (if they don't, they ruin the liabilities of the cities)

So... if you're in a town, you're an (official)

> ask to see current jd of public words, planning director, cfo, and see for yourself if they're aligned
figure out how to rise above the fray of "is the money being hidden or not", just say "we want everyone to be more successful"

"coming clean isn't about taking a bath"

Talking about how to help government officials come clean, and they should see what the public is willing to work with them on.

(holy shit this is revolutionary)

## COME CLEAN is a big part of this. 

"lets just stop worrying that we've had horrible things done to us in the past, lets just wipe it clean, start making this work now, and lets just fix things going forward"

instead of being shocked by crisis every 7 years, lets PLAN on something hard coming down the road?

### Us the people - plan on moving to cities that do this well. 

us moving to Golden will rapidly show the success of this applied to Golden, and will give examples of how it can be done elsewhere. We can make a massive difference. 

## Chuck last question:

"can federal/state governments FORCE municipalities to do this?"

Chuck: there's a misunderstanding of the alignment of how this all works....

their interests (state/federal/local) are not aligned. the state/federal will not lean on municipalities.

New Orleans was a good example - at a local level, Hurrican Sandy was horrible. At the federal level, it was GREAT! We cannot expect the federal government to care about this. Bad local events are GOOD for federal government. 

ONLY the people will pressure local governments. 

### 

Comments due tomorrow, not just a form letter tomorrow. (we're asking people to do a lot in a short period of time)

"have people write a few sentances down, then mention that you want to testify, then THAT will give you time to put down more thoughts, and you can THEN prepare for what you want to say"
